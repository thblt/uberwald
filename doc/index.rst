Überwald
========

Überwald is a minimal Lisp machine optimized for lightness, speed and
portability.  Überwald should run on any system which can be targeted
by a C11-compatible C compiler.  The core Lisp machine has absolutely
no dependencies besides libc (removal of the dependency on libc is a
project).
